## Query Development

### 1. Identify Best-Selling Products

You can measure “best-selling” by either total sales revenue or total quantity sold. For example, to rank products by total sales amount:

```sql
SELECT 
  p.ProductID, 
  p.ProductName, 
  SUM(f.SalesAmount) AS TotalSales, 
  SUM(f.Quantity) AS TotalQuantity
FROM fact_sales f
JOIN dim_products p ON f.ProductID = p.ProductID
GROUP BY p.ProductID, p.ProductName
ORDER BY TotalSales DESC;
```

This query joins your fact table with the product dimension, aggregates sales, and orders the products from highest to lowest revenue.

### 2. Segment Customers Based on Purchase Patterns

A simple segmentation might involve grouping customers by the number of purchases and total amount spent. For example:

```sql
SELECT 
  c.CustomerID, 
  c.FirstName, 
  c.LastName, 
  COUNT(f.SaleID) AS NumPurchases, 
  SUM(f.SalesAmount) AS TotalSpent
FROM fact_sales f
JOIN dim_customers c ON f.CustomerID = c.CustomerID
GROUP BY c.CustomerID, c.FirstName, c.LastName
ORDER BY TotalSpent DESC;
```

You can further refine this segmentation by adding recency (e.g., last purchase date) or frequency buckets to classify customers into segments like “high-value,” “frequent,” or “at-risk.”

### 3. Analyze Regional Sales Trends

Assuming the region information is stored in your customer dimension (or in a separate dim_region table), you can aggregate sales by region over time. For example, to see monthly sales by region:

```sql
SELECT 
  c.Region, 
  DATE_FORMAT(f.Timestamp, '%Y-%m') AS Month, 
  SUM(f.SalesAmount) AS MonthlySales
FROM fact_sales f
JOIN dim_customers c ON f.CustomerID = c.CustomerID
GROUP BY c.Region, DATE_FORMAT(f.Timestamp, '%Y-%m')
ORDER BY c.Region, Month;
```

This query shows how sales vary by region over each month, which can help you identify seasonal or regional trends.

## KPI Calculation

### 1. Total Sales Revenue

This KPI can be calculated with a simple aggregation over your fact table:

```sql
SELECT SUM(SalesAmount) AS TotalSalesRevenue
FROM fact_sales;
```

---

### 2. Sales Growth Rate

To compute the sales growth rate, you might compare total sales across two time periods (e.g., month-over-month). One approach using a window function is:

```sql
SELECT 
  Month, 
  TotalSales,
  LAG(TotalSales) OVER (ORDER BY Month) AS PreviousMonthSales,
  ROUND(((TotalSales - LAG(TotalSales) OVER (ORDER BY Month)) / LAG(TotalSales) OVER (ORDER BY Month)) * 100, 2) AS GrowthRatePercentage
FROM (
  SELECT DATE_FORMAT(Timestamp, '%Y-%m') AS Month, SUM(SalesAmount) AS TotalSales
  FROM fact_sales
  GROUP BY DATE_FORMAT(Timestamp, '%Y-%m')
) t;
```

This query calculates monthly sales and then uses the `LAG()` function to compare each month to the previous one.

---

### 3. Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)

A basic approach to CLV is to calculate the total revenue each customer has generated over their lifetime. For example:

```sql
SELECT 
  c.CustomerID, 
  c.FirstName, 
  c.LastName, 
  SUM(f.SalesAmount) AS LifetimeRevenue
FROM fact_sales f
JOIN dim_customers c ON f.CustomerID = c.CustomerID
GROUP BY c.CustomerID, c.FirstName, c.LastName
ORDER BY LifetimeRevenue DESC;
```

For a more refined CLV, you might incorporate metrics like purchase frequency and customer lifespan, but this query gives you a starting point.

### 4. Product Return Rate

If your fact table (or another table) includes data on returns (for example, a column named `ReturnFlag` where a value of 1 indicates a returned item), you can compute the return rate per product as follows:

```sql
SELECT 
  p.ProductID, 
  p.ProductName,
  SUM(CASE WHEN f.ReturnFlag = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS TotalReturns,
  COUNT(*) AS TotalSales,
  ROUND((SUM(CASE WHEN f.ReturnFlag = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*)) * 100, 2) AS ReturnRatePercentage
FROM fact_sales f
JOIN dim_products p ON f.ProductID = p.ProductID
GROUP BY p.ProductID, p.ProductName
ORDER BY ReturnRatePercentage DESC;
```

If you don’t have a `ReturnFlag` column, you might need to incorporate return data from another table or adjust your data model accordingly.
